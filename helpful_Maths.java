    /*
     * Xenia the beginner mathematician is a third year student at elementary
     * school. She is now learning the addition operation.
     *
     * The teacher has written down the sum of multiple numbers. Pupils should
     * calculate the sum. To make the calculation easier, the sum only contains
     * numbers 1, 2 and 3. Still, that isn't enough for Xenia. She is only beginning
     * to count, so she can calculate a sum only if the summands follow in
     * non-decreasing order. For example, she can't calculate sum 1+3+2+1 but she
     * can calculate sums 1+1+2 and 3+3.
     *
     * You've got the sum that was written on the board. Rearrange the summans and
     * print the sum in such a way that Xenia can calculate the sum.
     *
     * Input
     * The first line contains a non-empty string s â€” the sum Xenia needs to count.
     * String s contains no spaces. It only contains digits and characters "+".
     * Besides, string s is a correct sum of numbers 1, 2 and 3. String s is at most
     * 100 characters long.
     *
     * Output
     * Print the new sum that Xenia can count.
